<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I thought I was excited when I created a basic, black circle on my screen. Words cannot express what I felt when I got this simulation to work using variables, functions, conditionals, and scheduling computations! Our first task was to get the circle to move back and forth along the x-axis. Then, we needed to make it move back and forth diagonally. Lastly, as a challenge, we could change color, size, speed, etc.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Load the different HTML files to see the circles move around the screen. Movetest.html is the basic back and forth movement across the x-axis. MoveTest- Bonus.html shows diagonal movement. MoveTest- Bonus - Color.html shows the results of my challenge code. Play with it and make it your own!
